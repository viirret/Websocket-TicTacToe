# Websocket-TicTacToe

A school project about learning Node.js

# How to run the program

Start by cloning the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/viirret/Websocket-TicTacToe.git
```
Enter backend directory
```
cd backend
```
Install dependencies
```
npm install ws
```
Start Node.js server
```
node server.js
```
Open two instances of **frontend/index.html** in your web browser.

# Buildscript

This repository includes a buildscript for Linux that does those same commands.

Run it with:
```
chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
```

However you have to copy the other window, because you cannot create two windows in a script without creating a dependency to browser I don't wish to do that.
